# SMU-Project1-ShoppingTrends
As a group, we articulated the requirements for the project. We decided to use the Shopping trends dataset from Kaggle.com to start our exploratory data analysis and find trends in shopping. 
We analyzed the dataset and began with an overview of hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis, and standard statistical tests such as tTests. We created new branches with Gitkraken, drew and 
interpreted diagrams of Gitkraken branching workflows, and pushed individual branches to the GitHub main branch. We found that regression lines are not a good fit to predict relationships between age, 
the independent variable, and either Purchase Amount (USD)_avg or Review Rating_avg (dependent variables). Age and gender are independent variables with no significant effect on other variables in the dataset.
We also found there is no preferred payment method in the dataset. Our results suggest that the data collected was insufficient; more would have been specific data to refute the null hypotheses and that the retailers
should not base their market strategy on consumer demographics such as age or gender.
