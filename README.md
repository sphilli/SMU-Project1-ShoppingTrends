# SMU-Project1-ShoppingTrends
Welcome to the SMU Project1-ShoppingTrends repository! Our team has diligently collaborated to delve into the Shopping Trends dataset from Kaggle.com, aiming to uncover valuable insights through exploratory data analysis.

## Project Overview
In the initial stages, we collectively defined the project requirements, laying the foundation for our analysis. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Gitkraken, we meticulously managed our collaborative efforts by creating branches, illustrating Gitkraken branching workflows, and seamlessly integrating changes into the main GitHub branch.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
Our analysis commenced with a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, incorporating key statistical methodologies such as hypothesis testing and tTests. As we delved deeper, we focused on the relationships between variables, particularly age and gender, aiming to discern their impact on Purchase Amount (USD)_avg and Review Rating_avg.

### Key Findings
1. **Regression Lines Evaluation:** We determined that regression lines were not optimal for predicting relationships between age (independent variable) and either Purchase Amount (USD)_avg or Review Rating_avg (dependent variables).
2. **Independent Variables Impact:** Age and gender, identified as independent variables, exhibited no significant influence on other variables within the dataset.
3. **Payment Method Insights:** Surprisingly, we discovered no discernible preference for a specific payment method among the dataset participants.

## Implications and Recommendations
Our results emphasize the insufficiency of the collected data for drawing concrete conclusions. Consequently, caution is advised against basing market strategies solely on consumer demographics like age or gender. Further, we suggest a more targeted approach to data collection, emphasizing the need for specific data that can refute null hypotheses and provide a more nuanced understanding of shopping trends.
Feel free to explore our analysis and findings within this repository. We welcome collaboration, feedback, and further contributions to enhance the depth of our exploration into shopping trends. 

Happy coding!
